<section id="text2">The clothing industry is one of the most ancient industries. However, today very few companies in the field of clothing manufacturing earned the top positions globally.
The world saw the emergence of new trends and new fabrics in the clothing industry. Very few brands got famous all over the world and are still amongst the global best sellers.
The key is in the quality, perfection and setting trends</section>

<h3 id="child">Child labour in the clothing industry</h3>
<section> Unfortunately, Child labour remains a huge global problem.

    The International Labour Organisation (ILO) estimates that there are 160 million children involved in child labour as of their 2021 press release. Almost half of them (72.5 million) are involved in hazardous work.
    
    The ILO defines child labour as “work that deprives children of their childhood, their potential and their dignity, and that is harmful to physical and mental development”. It’s most likely to occur in the lower tiers of supply chains, in activities like raw material extraction and agriculture. 
    
    This is partly what makes traceability so challenging and an issue that fashion brands against child labour have to address.Cheap prices in the textile industry encourage child labor
    The fashion world is booming. There used to be a summer and a winter collection. Now, a new fashion collection comes out every month. From 2000 to 2015, the number of clothing purchases worldwide doubled, from about 50 billion garments to more than 100 billion.
    Each German alone buys 60 items of clothing per year, apparently in part indiscriminately: we almost never wear every fifth item of clothing in our closet, as a survey commissioned by Greenpeace shows. The curious thing about this is that although we are buying more and more, we are hardly spending more on clothing overall: From 2000 to 2018, Germans' spending on clothes increased by only about eight percent
